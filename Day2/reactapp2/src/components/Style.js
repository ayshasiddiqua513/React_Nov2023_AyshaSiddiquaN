            <p>It is a beautiful flower which has an appealing fragrance and colour.
               The flower is usually white or light pink in colour with boat-shaped petals. 
               The leaves of a lotus flower are large and dark green in colour. 
               The stem of the flower is very thick and it has a glowing yellow centre.Because lotuses rise from the mud without stains, they are often viewed as a symbol of purity.
                Since they return to the murky water each evening and open their blooms at 
               the break of day, lotus flowers are also symbols of strength, resilience, and rebirth</p>
